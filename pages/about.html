            <p class="detail-summary">A few important notes before you read this. A lot of information is simplified because I want to make this a short and simple read. The reason why I made this is because privacy is hard, and learning how to live a private life is hard. It's impossible to live a 100% anonymous life, but you can get close to 100%. Living an anonymous life is like a hurdle race: the goal is to place so many hurdles and obstacles behind you that people can't track you.</p>
            <p class="detail-summary">This is a guide on how to live an anonymous and private life, not on why you should. I'm assuming you already understand that nearly everything online tracks you. You should already know that Google, Microsoft, and Meta created one of the most privacy invasive websites and social media platforms. You should already know that your microphones on smartphones are always listening, and using a browser in incognito mode isn't private, etc. I'm assuming you already know what threat models are and what your threat models are.</p>
            <p class="detail-summary">Just because something is open source doesn't mean it's "safe" or "private."</p>

            <h3 class="detail-section-title">Anonymity VS Privacy</h3>
            <p class="detail-summary"><strong>Anonymity:</strong> Keeping your identity private, but not your actions. This is like using a social media app with a made up username instead of your real name.</p>
            <p class="detail-summary"><strong>Privacy:</strong> Privacy is about controlling access to your personal information or activities. It means others might know who you are, but they don’t necessarily get to see everything you do or say unless you allow it.</p>
